This is not a joke. Here we mean the original meaning and use of the word, zombie. Which you actually spell, zonbi.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pronunciation is the same, without the m. For the sake of familiarity and association, we will continue with the use of the word 'zombie.'\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan anyone tell me what country, the word zonbi is from?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaiti. Voodoo. In the original, Haitian sense of the word, zombies were servants created with different types of poisoning. And despite the Wikipedia article, zombies are not lore.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could take weeks, months, or years, but slow acting toxins were known, and were used to make 'zombies' in Haiti's not to distant cultural past.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFACT.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany more slow acting toxins have come to be known, chemical(s) which have highly predictable effects on individuals exposed to them.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFACT.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not above human nature to use these poisons on other humans to render them servile.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFACT.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if we generalize these processes historically recorded as 'zonbi' in Haiti by creating a few definitions, a useful social/psychological insight can be had.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin our generalization, we note that a Haitian zombie does not exist as a stereotype. A person is not either A) zombie, or B) not zombie. This is a spectrum. There are many degrees to which an animal can be made into a zombie. Just as no 2 people are exactly alike, no 2 zombies are exactly alike.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, consider any way in which an individual's behavior or mind can be manipulated by another individual.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of us are familiar with the idea of social manipulation. Humans socially manipulate in an effort to get what we want. Their social manipulation does not, in general 'train' those they wish would serve them.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the cumulative, lasting effect, common social manipulation is separate from the concept of zombie. Social manipulation can be cumulative, in which case one is certainly entering the realm of the zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key point of zombie is the aspect of servility. You cannot separate Zombies from the master/slave relationship. Though they need not serve a person; a zombie may serve any purpose, be it an abstract symbolism or moving dirt.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, a plowing beast of burden is a zombie, but Zombie specifically applies to the human species. To concretely construct the generalization of zombie, it is very useful to consider animals other than humans.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a most basic and direct example of zombification (making zombies), one should consider Pavlov's dog drool;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sentence: associate a 'neural network' (hearing bell ring) to a known response (salivating) through measured and controlled environmental exposures (food and bell.)\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePavlov's dog is now part zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhibit A: a very low degree canine zombie, made to drool at the ring of a bell.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Pavlov's dog is A) not human and B) serves no purpose other than Pavlov's scientific measurement. This is still a perfect example of the weakest end of the zombie spectrum. You may rest assured you could get a young human, or even an adult, to react in the exact same way. Such treatment of humans is generally illegal, but do not believe this stops everyone from engaging it.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother key to this extrapolation of Zombie is that the environmental exposure or conditioning was knowingly carried out to achieve a specific response in the individual undergoing zombification, and that the 'higher mental functions' of a human do not override your carefully executed conditioning/exposure.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, zombification is not benevolent, though it can be neutral or benign as with a drooling dog.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one attempts to alter behaviors and minds in a way that results in a more healthy, aware individual, it's not zombie. Again, zombies do not exist outside of the concepts of servitude and slavery.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne can be more heavy handed than Pavlov, and attempt to create a zombie via lobotomy. One can have a faint idea of which neural network you are trying to cut out of existence, but you do not have a very fine control. Not that the surgical, or Eternal Sunshine approach won't some day.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounding far fetched? That's because Zombies aren't real. Not even in Haiti!\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a few measurements from the Haitian method. Very real, and very bad medicine carefully dosed over weeks, months, and years;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upon analysis of the powders, Davis found that 7 of them shared a number of ingredients, including toxins produced by cane toad (Bufo marinus) and an irritant produced by a hyla tree frog (Osteopilus dominicensis.) One of the samples\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealso contained trace amounts of tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced by various marine organisms, most notably the pufferfish.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[The] second powder is thought to contain atropine and scopolamine, toxic and dissociative hallucinogenic compounds derived from the plants Datura stramonium and Datura metel, both of which are known in Haiti as the \u0026acirc;ï¿½ï¿½zombie cucumber.\u0026acirc;ï¿½ï¿½\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, through controlled chemical exposure and social manipulation, one arrives at the traditional Haitian 'zonbi'.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr you can try your very own recipe. Start neurochemically altering brains with all kinds of unheard of exposures (SSRI, TCA, MAOI, etc) you recently discovered, and presto!\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerican zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was kind of funny, but it should be terrifying.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn first consideration, one should counter: but anti-depressants are made to help people!\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, except 'suicidal thoughts' and 'disturbing dreams' are listed as side effects.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, except there exists very little information on what years of exposure to these chemicals does to people.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, except it is known that anti-depressants are not a cure for depression. They attempt to alleviate a symptom which is hardly understood by individuals prescribing the chemicals. Simultaneously, the chemicals make it very difficult for an individual to treat the cause of their mental problems.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems, no. These chemicals 'help' people like alcohol 'helps' people alleviate emotional turmoil.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich of users of SSRI, TCA, MAOI, etc, would describe themselves as 'more healthy and aware' when under the influence of these chemicals?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many individuals who were prescribed these chemicals, used them for years, and then resolved their emotional/mental issues, would suggest other people use them? I only know 4 people who have used them, and they give me an answer of zero. Zero individuals.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs most people know, the purpose of these 'pharmaceuticals' is to sell pills. Their purpose is not to change or cure the condition, it is to generate wealth for the masters.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all the credentials of their purveyors, many American mental pharmaceuticals are definitely in the realm of the zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it is more accurate to call it, American Zombie research.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not equating The American Medical Association with Haitian witch doctors, we are only noting their similarities.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American Medical Association is just trying to make pleasant, bland zombies that generate revenue. Zombies that mindlessly rise and eat in the night, like an Ambien Zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, an American Zombie murders dozens of strangers in a public place. That is a crazy zombie. Most zombies are lazy and dumb, but if the master is willing to go to a whole new level of evil, zombies can be made quick and deadly.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver wonder where the behavior of James Eagan Holmes and his ilk has its genesis?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and blame it on the 'bad apple' individual if it helps you sleep at night; James Holmes committed mass murder because he is an evil killer. A tormented, terrible person.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes this explanation assert that his mind was not somehow primed for such behavior?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Holmes is tormented and terrible, just because that's how some people are?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a useless assertion whose effect is to limit our understanding of a very important concept.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is that mindless massacre of anything more than a handful of voiceless animals in childhood comes from without, not from within. Demented and tortuous nurture, and not nature.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow say you wanted to make a zombie killing machine. One alleged attempt of some Pavlovian conditioning reads as follows;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1] When the child is 2 years old, place them in a metal cage with electrodes attached. Shock the child severely. [2] Take the child out, and place a kitten in its hands. Tell the child to wring the kitten's neck. The child will cry and refuse. [3] Put the child into the cage, and shock them until they are dazed and cannot scream any more. [4] Take the child out, and tell them again to wring the kitten's neck. This time the child will shake all over, cry, but do it, afraid of the torture. The child will then go into the corner and vomit afterwards, while the adult praises them for \"doing such a good job\".\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the first step. The animals get bigger over time, as the child gets older. They will be forced to kill an infant at some point, either a set up or VR, or in reality. They will be taught by age 9 to put together a gun, to aim, and fire on target and on command. They will then practice on realistic manikins. They will then practice on animals. They will then practice on \"expendables\" or in VR. They will be highly praised if they do well, and tortured if they don't comply.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older the child or teen, the more advanced the training. By age 15, most children will also be forced to do hand to hand combat in front of spectators (high people who come to watch the \"games\" much as the ancient gladiators performed). These matches are rarely done to the death, usually until one child goes down. They use every type of weapon imaginable, and learn to fight for their lives. If a child loses a fight, they are heavily punished by their trainer, who loses \"face\". If they win, they are again praised for being \"strong' and adept with weapons. This is how children in the German Illuminati are brought up, I went through it myself.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, killing, and then not knowing why or hardly who you killed is going full zombie. Say Hi, Sirhan!\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the most abstract, finest degree of zombification, we have the shows we choose to watch. All lovers of a show generate a zombie. Here at a minimal degree, we can equate the words fan and zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose is benign. Selling a theater ticket is not evil, but do not deny that it serves the theater along with your own pleasure of entertainment. The programming is generally ambiguous, but a 'game of thrones' fan will have predictable differences with a 'golden girls' fan, even if the shows themselves did not generate these differences.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo all fans are this slight degree of zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's okay to be a zombie. We're all a little bit zombie. Humans are creatures of habit and routine. It's only a question of how many habits and routines were created with a controlled environment to serve another interest.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine the scale. It represents all degrees of zombie on the spectrum. You have traditional Haitian, which is getting close to the top. And way down near the bottom, you have fan. You have everything in between, all kinds of benign or malevolent ritualistic mindless culture that may only serve to propagate the culture.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost zombies are harmless. Observe, a Yum!Brand/Walmart zombie. Just don't get between her and her chicken.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther zombies are more dangerous. The lust-is-sin, matrimonial-anti-sex league zombies can be volatile.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we can watch South Park deconstruct a type of zombie for us. Poor Kenny. \"You think god is in control?\"\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://southpark.cc.com/clips/221278/nobody-is-ruining-this-event\"\u003ehttp://southpark.cc.com/clips/221278/nobody-is-ruining-this-event\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow really. The content of this episode is not simply a cartoon. Add this shit up. Human's must be primed for Mr. Mouse's plan to work.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not an abstract conspiracy.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is mathematical and methodical.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisney zombies are real things, and it's not so different from the kind of zombie that say, wants to bury you up to your waste and bludgeon you to death by hurling rocks at you for getting some without marriage, i.e. a sharia zombie.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFun fact, Walt Disney, the original genius Disney zombie programmer, was a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason. You should speculate on the historical genesis of Scottish rite freemasonry another time.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere the point is, there are all kinds of people out there making zombies. Not just Walt Disney making zombies, or fundamentalist clerics making zombies, or the forces that seek to expose you to lead making zombies, Political zombies, Pharmaceutical zombies, Television zombies, Cannabis zombies...\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, so many zombies. And there's all kinds of experiments going on. Somebody comes up with a new zombie recipe like every year.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most common and oldest type is the breeding nationalistic zombie. This is a somewhat naturally occurring thing, but it becomes zombie when states and cultures seek to amplify its presence. They often do.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorthwhile cultures seek to minimize its presence and impact. Worthwhile cultures do not keep zombies.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a collection of engineered habits. Some by nature. Some not.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs money, food and water scarce? Irrelevant. Be fruitful and Multiply. No need to stop scorning your children for not giving you grand children.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main point of creating the myriad of parents who never really chose to be parents, is their barely raised offspring. It's a sad truth that Ma and Pa had no wisdom to pass on, no ways of life to respect.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa and Pa did have a bunch of miserable habits and anxieties they managed to inadvertently pass on. Gluttony and sloth are okay. Cheeseburgers and television. Use alcohol, but not other psychoactives literally appearing of their own volition in the forest.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe a fool for foolish programming. Local rapes? Damn straight I want to hear about it on the local news. My new's programming contains a minimum of numbers, a maximum of murder stories. Complexities like the specifics of currency management and banking have no place in my information stream, as I do not like to be confused. I don't know them, and they aren't news.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don't have nor want any activism in my life. I'm past my prime, the culturally endorsed breeding period, and so I'm entitled to more or less resigning from life. I had children, so now my purpose is over. I will not find another one.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'll vote democrat and I'm done. As long as my beer/wine/entertainment/chicken supply isn't interrupted.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre these parents who never really chose to be parents just a biological tragedy? There exists an emotional compulsion to have kids we do not understand. It has been conceived of as a 'Selfish Gene.'\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of the individual thinking and acting from moment to moment, the concept of DNA as a mindless self propagating survival machine is totally useless. The perspective provides no understanding as to why one person decides to have no children, 1 child, or 8 children. Not to imply that all parents who have 8 children did so due to an environment manipulated in an interest that was not the parents'.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biological impulse exists, but many people have children because it is socially impressed upon their psyche as what 'normal' people do. They do not want to be what their culture has subtly or unconsciously told them they will become if they do not have children by a given age.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a result of culture, Which very much can be engineered and manipulated, be it through the likes of state dictated curricula, religion, or ingenious adepts like Disney.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurposely getting masses of people to have a bunch of babies they hardly can or will raise to be healthy peaceful adults, is a concept so dark most people refuse to believe such a conspiracy exists.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet instances of it are recorded in history.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undeniable cases can hardly be called conspiracy, as they are limited to warlords who go on record saying, \"I'm all for child soldiers in my army.\"\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKony wanted you to get pregnant, in case you weren't sure what to do. You may not have found much to do with your child, but he had a machete and AK-47 waiting for him.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you don't think this is happening on a grander and subtler scale? Just because Walt Disney never went on record discussing what perspectives or impulses his programming may impart, doesn't mean he or even individuals purposely manipulating Disney himself weren't aware of them. It's happening everywhere, in the shadows.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistory textbooks are always trying to teach, slavery was abolished.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, with the spectrum and degrees. The most tangible and institutionalized form was abolished. One form, of many.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spectrum of zombie has always been present in human civilization.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is currently engulfing many urban centers.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeware.
