However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers\nexplicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of\na packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination\nof a given transmission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track\nthe connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor\ntraffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or\nillegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).  Attempts to\nseize this router will accomplish nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003c!-- FIXME: May or may not be US-only.
